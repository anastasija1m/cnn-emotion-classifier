# Emotion Detection Project with CNN Based on Facial Expressions

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an Emotion Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions. The goal is to accurately classify human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust or neutral emotion based on input images of faces.

## Introduction

Emotion detection is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction, enabling systems to respond empathetically to user emotions. This project employs a CNN-based approach to recognize and classify facial expressions accurately. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial expressions corresponding to different emotions.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Facial Expression Recognition FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset.

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Visit the [Facial Expression Recognition FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) on Kaggle.
   - Download the dataset and place it in the "images" folder of this project.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Train the Model:**
   - Run the notebook file ```emotion-detection-from-facial-expressions.ipynb``` to execute the project. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed, or run it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anastasijamarsenic/emotion-detection-from-facial-expressions).
